## Data reconstruction

Physics-embedded recurrent convolutional neural network for data-driven modeling

### Training and extrapolation results
We show the reconstruction and extrapolation performance of our PeCRNN on 2D Gray-Scott equation below:

## Datasets
Due to the file size limit, we attach the google drive [[link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1uZd7_OtbWuBJ0j-guJ0Ddva2V7nQ2VTM)] to download the datasets.

## Requirements
- pytorch>=1.6 is recommended
- plotly is needed to plot isosurface for 3D case
- TF 1.0 is required for DHPM
